<p>
  The current implementation of GStreamerFilter only allows single elements to
  be injected; one cannot indicate more than one at the same time; use several
  GStreamerFilters if you need to inject more than one element into the
  pipeline.
</p>
<p>
  Note that usage of some popular GStreamer elements requires installation of
  additional packages. For example, overlay elements such as
  <em>timeoverlay</em> or <em>textoverlay</em> require installation of the
  <strong>gstreamer1.5-x</strong> package, which will also install the
  <em>Pango</em> rendering library.
